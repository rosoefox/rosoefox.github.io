Kim Gahyun, a researcher in AI livestock technology.
I am a junior developer majoring in the Department of Animal and Biotechnology and Computer Artificial Intelligence at Chonbuk National University.
We are developing a smart livestock system and animal breeding program using AI.
We are also deeply interested in League of Legends and are producing programs on Banpick and matching systems, which have recently become important.
It is a developer who is expected to be in the future with its strength in rapid skill acquisition and willingness to grow.
