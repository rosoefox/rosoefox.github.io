I am currently researching breeding systems using BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction).
Breeding is the process of creating new varieties or improving existing ones by utilizing their genetic traits.
I am developing research programs that apply BLUP to more efficiently improve the breeds of livestock such as pigs, cattle, and poultry.
This work helps overcome the limitations of traditional breeding methods, allowing for the effective utilization of superior genetics.
